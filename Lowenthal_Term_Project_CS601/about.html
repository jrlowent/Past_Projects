                    I was born in Southern Maryland, and have lived here most of my life.  
                    I currently live about 45 minutes Southeast of Washington, D.C. My father is from 
                    outside of Baltimore City, and my mother is from New England. Before I was born, 
                    my parents moved down to Southern Maryland due to my father's work.  
                    My mom used to be a nurse, but stopped to raise my brother and I.  I have 
                    one older brother who is also a graduate student in a combined M.D./Ph.D. 
                    program, and a family dog named Melody.  There is a picture of my dog on my home page.

                    While growing up, I cycled through many different career aspirations, some of 
                    them more realistic than others.  For a long time, I wanted to become a professional 
                    musician and go to school for music.  However, I realized that I would likely need to tour, 
                    and the lifestyle of being a touring musician is not for me.  I studied psychology 
                    during my undergraduate education with the intention of studying cognitive neuroscience 
                    later.  My career ideas shifted a bit, but still fell within that realm.  After graduating, I 
                    worked in clinical research for a period of time.  However, I realized that that career
                    path was not for me.  I took a step back and started to explore programming.  Eventually,
                    I fell on web development, and now I am studying exactly that at Boston University.

                    In my free time, I like to keep music in my life and to stay active.  I have been 
                    playing drums for almost 16 years, and guitar for almost 13.  I also like to lift weights
                    and do cardiovascular exercise. These activities have truly had a positive impact on my life,
                    so I do not plan on giving them up anytime soon.  I like to explore new places, go to 
                    concerts, do outdoor activities, spend time with friends and family, and watch movies.  I 
                    also like to spend time learning more programming-related things.
